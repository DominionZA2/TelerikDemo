            <h3>What is Artificial Intelligence?</h3>
            <p>AI is the simulation of human intelligence by machines programmed to think and learn like humans. It encompasses a wide range of technologies and approaches, from rule-based systems to machine learning and deep neural networks. Modern AI systems can process natural language, recognize images, make decisions, and learn from experience, much like humans do.</p>
            <p>The field of AI has evolved significantly since its inception in the 1950s. Today, it powers everything from smartphone assistants to autonomous vehicles, making it an integral part of our daily lives. The technology continues to advance rapidly, with new breakthroughs in areas like natural language processing and computer vision happening regularly.</p>

    <TabStripTab Title="AI Assistants">
        <Content>
            <h3>Virtual Assistants</h3>
            <p>AI-powered assistants have become increasingly sophisticated in handling everyday tasks and providing support. These virtual assistants can now understand context, remember previous interactions, and provide personalized responses to user queries. They're being used in customer service, healthcare, education, and personal productivity, transforming how we interact with technology.</p>
            <p>Recent advances in natural language processing have made these assistants more natural and effective in their communications. They can now handle complex conversations, understand nuanced requests, and even detect emotional undertones in user interactions. This has led to their widespread adoption in both professional and personal settings, making them invaluable tools for productivity and assistance.</p>

    <TabStripTab Title="AI Ethics">
        <Content>
            <h3>Ethical Considerations</h3>
            <p>The ethical implications of AI development and deployment are vast and complex. Privacy concerns arise from AI systems' ability to collect and process massive amounts of personal data. Transparency issues center around the "black box" nature of some AI algorithms, where even their creators may not fully understand how they reach specific decisions. These challenges are particularly critical in high-stakes applications like healthcare and criminal justice.</p>
            <p>The moral implications of AI decision-making extend to questions of accountability and responsibility. When AI systems make mistakes or cause harm, determining who is responsible becomes complicated. Additionally, ensuring AI systems align with human values and ethical principles while remaining effective and efficient is an ongoing challenge that requires careful consideration and robust frameworks.</p>
